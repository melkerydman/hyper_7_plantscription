Plant subscription e-com | Hyper Island, Module 7 - Code and Collaborate

The brief for module 7 at Hyper Island - Code and Collaborate. A module focused on team work and agile methods, while creating an e-commerce site.

### :briefcase: Brief

Create an e-commerce - while utilising agile and SCRUM methodology.

### :mantelpiece_clock: Time frame

4 weeks.

### :dart: Goals:

We set the main goal as a team to focus on the process of working as a team, rather than the end result. This was definitely my main personal focus and goal as well.

### :fountain: Initial work, idea and planning

We set up a shared environment and spent a lot of time initially to get everyone on-board with the structure. Setting up a Git workflow, prettier and rules for how to create things such as components.

We also set up a structure for documenting our work and progress in order have a reference point to return to.

We mapped our different competencies in order to decide on tech stack and how to split tasks and pairs in future coding session.

Ideation led to a simple shop selling plants with a subscription model (which we scrapped for the MVP), creating three personas.

### :mount_fuji: Process, thoughts and learnings

Probably my favourite module so far, I’ve been able to tie together a lot of knots.
We worked in four sprints, with daily stand-ups and weekly reviews and retrospectives - incredibly helpful in moving forward and improving.
Experienced mob and pair-programming.
Improved task management with Trello, creating more descriptive cards and tasks.
Improved Git workflow utilising branches more than I ever have - and really experiencing the value of it.

I could make the list of learnings from this module a mile long, but some key take-aways are:
- Slice the product like a cake - deliver features. We started out deciding to create the backend first and then the frontend but learned that creating a fully functioning, demoable feature that spans both back- and frontend makes more sense - both to us and a client.
- Prioritise the most valuable feature. Building on the above, we set out to create a login, but were made aware of the fact that the feature that creates most value should be prioritised - in our case that meant starting with a page displaying products.
- Make the product interactive - even if its just mock functionality like an alert or console.log.
- Set up a production path from the beginning. Having a sandbox the client can access from scratch saves you time, and potentially creates a deliverable faster.

In general it’s been very rewarding working as a team an really applying the learnings from one week to our work the next.
